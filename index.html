              Although there are vaccines now developed to prevent coronavirus
              disease 2019 (COVID-19), the best way to prevent illness is to
              avoid being exposed to this virus. To learn more about the
              vaccines, visit the CDC’s page
              <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/8-things.html"
                >here</a
              >. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday
              preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory
              diseases, including:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
              <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
              <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
              <li>
                Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue
                in the trash.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces
                using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
              </li>
              <li>
                Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a
                    facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases,
                    including COVID-19.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of
                    COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to
                    others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health
                    workers and people who are taking care of someone in close
                    settings (at home or in a health care facility).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20
                seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating;
                and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If soap and water are not readily available, use an
                    alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
                    Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly
                    dirty. For information about handwashing, see CDC’s
                    Handwashing website

              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
              the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to
              moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
              treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require
              medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical
              conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
              respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious
              illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously
              ill or die at any age.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
              informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect
              yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre
              apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing
              your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get
              vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in
              small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or
              breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to
              smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory
              etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to
              stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.
            </p>
            <p>Stay informed:</p>
